# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch in function arguments.

The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum. However, the code attempts to call the function with a string and a number, resulting in a compile-time error.

The solution demonstrates how to fix this issue using type guards or more specific function signatures.
